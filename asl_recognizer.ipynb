In particular, this project employs  [hidden Markov models (HMM's)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) to analyze a series of measurements taken from videos of American Sign Language (ASL) collected for research (see the [RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php)).  In this video, the right-hand x and y locations are plotted as the speaker signs the sentence.\n",

As a simple starting example, we train a single word using Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM).   By using the `fit` method during training, the [Baum-Welch Expectation-Maximization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm) (EM) algorithm is invoked iteratively to find the best estimate for the model *for the number of hidden states specified* from a group of sample seequences. For this example, we *assume* the correct number of hidden states is 3, but that is just a guess.  How do we know what the \"best\" number of states for training is?  We will need to find some model selection technique to choose the best parameter."

    "##### Cross-validation folds\n",
    "If we simply score the model with the Log Likelihood calculated from the feature sequences it has been trained on, we should expect that more complex models will have higher likelihoods. However, that doesn't tell us which would have a better likelihood score on unseen data.  The model will likely be overfit as complexity is added.  To estimate which topology model is better using only the training data, we can compare scores using cross-validation.  One technique for cross-validation is to break the training set into \"folds\" and rotate which fold is left out of training.  The \"left out\" fold scored.  This gives us a proxy method of finding the best model to use on \"unseen data\". In the following example, a set of word sequences is broken into three folds using the [scikit-learn Kfold](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html) class object. When you implement `SelectorCV`, you will use this technique."

There are a number of references on the internet for this criterion.  These [slides](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02433/doc/ch6_slides.pdf) include a formula you may find helpful for your implementation.\n",

    "**Question 3:**  Summarize the error results from three combinations of features and model selectors.  What was the \"best\" combination and why?  What additional information might we use to improve our WER?  For more insight on improving WER, take a look at the introduction to Part 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A - SelectorCV + features_polar. WER = 0.607  (wall time: 112s)\n",
    "\n",
    "B - SelectorBIC + features_polar. WER = 0.545  (wall time: 71s)\n",
    "\n",
    "C - SelectorCV  + features_custom(delta2). WER = 0.539  (wall time: 118s)\n",
    "\n",
    "The best combination, SelectorCV + features_custom(delta2), is mainly due to an acurrate choice for the custom features \"delta2\":\n",
    "- With normalized features, the recognizer always performed worse than with the other features analyzed. \n",
    "- With polar features, less than 60% could be achieved with DIC and BIC only (54.4%). \n",
    "- With delta features, however, the recognizer never produced a word error rate lower than 60%, being the best result, 61.2%, obtained with selectorCV. \n",
    "- After using the custom \"delta2\" features it was easy to get error rates lower than 60% for the three model selectors, allowing a better comparison of the them, where SelectorCV had a better performance than BIC and DIC (opposite to using polar features)\n",
    "\n",
    "Attending the running time, BIC model selector is the fastest for all tests for the reasons discussed in part 2 followed by Cross-Validation (~1.5 times longer), and finally DIC (~3 times longer). DIC was discarded after the first combinations since similar or better performances were usually reached with cross-validation and BIC, also needing less running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to improve our WER we could modify \"delta2\" or \"polar\" including terms from other features or combinations of features (linear function, etc.). Other variables like zoom and hand orientations, unavailable in this project, could help to elaborate more accurate features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better option is to include statistical data (as suggested in the lesson and also proposed in the optional exercise) with information about the occurrence of a word in a sentence, or the probability of the word to appears next to other words (biased priors could be created before training). By using semantics rules, for example, a heuristic strategy based on previous sequences could restrict the search to meaningful words only. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, as we are using ordered sequences, we could implement a recurrent neural network (LSTM) to improve our WER.\n",
